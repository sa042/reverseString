# reverseString
In this project I have implemented 6 different ‘expressions’ that have the same functionality - to reverse a string. Those are as follow:<br />
i. I have implemented function template in template_reverse.cpp file which can take string/string&/vector as an input and do the reverse of the content.<br />
ii. I have implemented template class and member function in reverse.cpp file. Both string and vector are used as an input to set the private variable of this class. 
reverse() member of this class do the reverse for both string and vector.<br />
iii. I have implemented function object concepts in the function_object.cpp file to reverse the string. <br />
iv.  ! operator is overloaded in my implementation. Overloaded is defined in the overloaded_operator.cpp file.<br />
v. I have implemented the closures in the uni_test.cpp file to reverse the string and bind it to a reference.<br />
vi. A structural pattern decorators is defined in decorators.hpp file to reverse the string.<br />
I have tested all of the above expressions from unit_test.cpp file.
